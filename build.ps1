# build.ps1 — one-shot build of the FlatUI portable exe on Windows.
#
# Usage:
#   .\build.ps1
#
# What it does:
#   1. Verifies the prerequisites (calls .\prereqs-check.ps1).
#   2. Installs npm dependencies (npm install).
#   3. Builds the frontend (npm run build  →  dist\).
#   4. Builds the Rust backend in release mode for x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.
#   5. Prints the location of the resulting flatui.exe.
#
# Re-running is safe: every step is idempotent and incremental (cargo will
# reuse cached artifacts from previous runs).
